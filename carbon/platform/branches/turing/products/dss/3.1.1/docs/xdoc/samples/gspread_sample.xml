        <h1>Google Spreadsheet Sample</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            An often used data sharing format in the internet is using Google Spreadsheet. <a href="http://wso2.org/projects/data-services-server/java">WSO2 Data Services Server</a> contains support for using a Google Spreadsheet as a data source.
        </p>
        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>
            The sample data service "GSpreadSample" should be deployed as per the instructions mentioned in <a href="deploying_samples.html">Deploying Samples</a> section.
        </p>
        <h2>Running the Sample</h2>
        <p>The sample service can be run using the "tryit" tool, which is bundled with <a href="http://wso2.org/projects/data-services-server/java">WSO2 Data Services Server</a>, or a code-generated java client sample using this service is demonstrated in the <a href="ds_clients.html">Data Services Clients Sample</a> section.
        </p>
        <h2>Google Spreadsheet Contents</h2>
        <p>
            The spreadsheet contains data about the customers of a specific company. 
        </p>
        <h2>Service Definition</h2>
        <p>
            The GSpread sample service contains a single operation named "getCustomers" which returns all the customer information that are stored in the google spreadsheet. There is also a resource defined as "customers", which can be accessed with the following URL,
<a href="http://localhost:9763/services/GSpreadSample.HTTPEndpoint/customers">http://localhost:9763/services/GSpreadSample.HTTPEndpoint/customers</a>. 
        </p>
        <h2>Sample Run</h2>
        <p>
            A sample run of the service using the "tryit" tool is shown below. <br />
