        <p>The WSO2 Data Services Server is an extremely simple and elegant mechanism to take data
            and make it available as a set of WS-* style Web services or as a set of REST style Web
            resources. It augments SOA development efforts by providing an easy to use platform for
            creating and hosting data services. This enables easy integration of data into business
            processes, mashups, gadgets, BI applications and any service in general.

        <p>The WSO2 Data Services Server is built on top of the WSO2 Carbon platform. It utilizes
            many features made available by the Carbon platform. A data service can be summarized
            into a XML descriptor file written in compliance with Data Services Descriptor Language
            (DSDL). DSDL is a XML based language defined by WSO2 to write data services.
        </p>

        <p>A custom deployer, written extending the Apache Axis2 deployer framework is responsible
            for reading this data service descriptor and creating a data service. High performant
            XML processing capabilities offered by Apache AXIOM is used for generating XML responses
            on the fly. Some of the third party open source projects used by the WSO2 Data Services
            Server includes Apache DBCP for managing connection pools for Relational Databases,
            Google Spreadsheet Data API for reading Google Spreadsheets, OpenCSV for CSV file
            support and Apache POI for MS-Excel support.
