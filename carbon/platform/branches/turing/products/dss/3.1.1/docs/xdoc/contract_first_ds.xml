        <h1>Contract First Data Services</h1>
        <p>WSO2 Data Services Server provides the functionality which can simply create a data
            service for
            a given WSDL.
        </p>
        <h2>Create contract first data service</h2>
        <p>Go through the following steps to create a simple contract first data service.</p>
        <p>Click on Contract First link in left menu under Manage/Services/Add/Data Service. Create
            Contract Service wizard will be appear. You can either provide a wsdl file which is
            located in
            your local file system or you can provide a wsdl which is hosted online.
        </p>
        <p>Once you select the wsdl file it will appear as in following figure.</p>

            <br/>
            <br/>
        </p>
        <p>Click on 'Upload' button after you have select the file. If the wsld is uploaded
            successfully
            you will get the success message as follows.
        </p>

                 alt="Contract first wsdl upload"/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
        </p>
        <p>Created data service will be list in the services listing page, as a work in progress
            service. Since we cannot specify the data source configuration and the sql query in the
            wsdl, the created
            service will be deployed as a WIP service. Therefore the wsdls, and the tryit links will
            not be provided in the service list page.
        </p>
        <p>

            <br/>
            <br/>
        </p>
        <p>Click on 'Edit Data Service Wizard' to fill the dummy data which has generated in the
            data
            service.
        </p>
        <p>Following image shows the dummy data which has filled in the add data source page. Change
            them according to the required information. Same steps has to be followed for the query
            page
            as well to change the dummy sql query.
        </p>

            <br/>
            <br/>
        </p>
        <p>Once you have enter all the details click on 'Finish' button, this will deploy the
            service
            and list down the service in the service list page as a active service.
        </p>
        <p>Sample wsdl which we used to create the service is showing below.</p>
