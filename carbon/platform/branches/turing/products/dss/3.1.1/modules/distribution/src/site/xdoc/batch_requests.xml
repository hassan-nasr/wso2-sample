        <h1>Batch Request Support</h1>
        
        <p>
            <b>Introduction</b>
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>
            <a href="http://wso2.com/products/data-services-server/">WSO2 Data Services Server</a>
            provides the capability to support batch requests for operations, which contain multiple
            parameter sets for a single request. When a data service is created with the batch
            request mode set, for all the in-only operations (operations which does not have any
            return value), a corresponding batch operation will also be automatically created. This
            batch operation will taken in an array of parameters lists, compared to the single
            parameter list the non-batch operation require.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h1>Configuring batch request for a data service</h1>
        
        <p>In order to make an operation supporting batch requests, first you need to enable the
            batch request functionality in the data service. Therefore, enable the batch request
            when creating the data service.

        <br/>

        <p>Then you can define data sources, queries and operations for the data service.
        Figure 2 and Figure 3 show you the sample insert query and the operation created for that.</p>

        <br/>

        <p>Once the operations are created and the service is deployed, corresponding batch operation
            will be created according to the given operation. For the above sample operation
            "addEmployee", the corresponding batch operation is "addEmployee_batch_req". You can see
            this by clicking the "Try this service" as in the Figure 4.

        <p>Figure 4: Try it</p>
        <br/>

        <p>You can use "try it" tool for testing the batch requests support. For that click on
            corresponding batch request operation. In this sample click on "addEmployee_batch_req"
            operation. This will give you a request SOAP body for inserting one data set as shown in
            the Figure 4.
        </p>
        <p>You can change the request SOAP body to handle multiple requests by repeating the SOAP body
            use in single request. Figure 5 shows the request SOAP message for inserting two data sets
            using the "addEmployee_batch_req" operation.</p>
