        <h1>Complex Elements</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Complex Elements helps to represent the data in a tructured manner. For an example, let's take
	    a table which contains customer information. There can be several columns which keep data related to the address,
	    such as number, street, city, postal code. By using complex elements, this can be group into a one element called 
	    address and represent this in more structured manner.            
        </p>
        <p>How to create complex elements</p>
        <p>Following example illustrates how to use complex elements. Figure 1 shows the query, which the sample going to use.</p>

                Figure 1: Defining the query
        </p>
        <p>After defining the query, under output mappings, select the Mapping Type as complex element. By giving a Element
        Name add on 'Add Nested Element' to enter the elements, which should come under nested elements. As for the figure
        illustrating below addressline1, addressline2 and city are nested elements which comes under address element.</p>

                Figure 2: Adding complex elements
        </p>
        <p>
          Added complex element will be listed under output mappings table as below.
