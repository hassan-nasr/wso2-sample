        <h1>Manage Logging</h1>

        <p>This page contains server settings for logging. Logging settings include
            <a class="externalLink" href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/index.html">Log4J</a>
            <a href="#loggers">Loggers</a>
            and
            <a class="externalLink" href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/index.html">Log4J</a>
            <a href="#appenders">Appenders</a>
            . Loggers filter the log messages to
            Appenders, while Appenders filter the messages for the second time before
            writing them to the log files.
        </p>
        <a name="loggers"></a>
        <h3 id="Configure">Configure Log4J Loggers:</h3>
        <p>Log4J Loggers contain the value's Name, Log Level and Additivity.
            The
            <strong>Log level</strong>
            list contains TRACE, INFO, DEBUG, WARN, ERROR,
            FATAL and OFF from which any one can be selected. Once you select a Log
            Level, only the messages at that level and below will be logged. For example,
            if you select Log Level ERROR, then all ERROR and FATAL messages will be
            logged or rather passed on to the Appender. Switching on

            <strong>Additivity</strong>
            allows to inherit all the Appenders of the parent
            Logger.
        </p>
        <a name="appenders"></a>
        <h3 id="Configure1">Configure Log4J Appenders:</h3>
        <p>Log4J Appenders include values for the Appender Name, Log level, known as
            Threshold in this case, Log Pattern and Log File.
        </p>
        <p>The
            <strong>Threshold</strong>
            list is the same as the Log Level in
            Loggers, in name and action. The
            <strong>Log Pattern</strong>
            allows you to
            edit the format or the layout in which the logs are created. You can have a
            look at the
            <a class="externalLink"
               href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/api/org/apache/log4j/PatternLayout.html">
                log4j
                PatternLayout
            </a>

            page to learn the meanings of the values that are used in
            the log pattern. Finally you can change the location of the log file with the
            <strong>Log File</strong>
            option.
        </p>

        <h3>Persist Configuration Changes:</h3>
        <p>Check this if you want any changes you make to the logging configuration to persist
            even after a server restart. If not checked, logging will be configured with the default
            settings.
        </p>
        <h3>Global Log4J Configuration:</h3>
        <p>Note that by using the Global Log4J Configuration options, you can set the
            Log Level and Log Pattern of Log4J Appenders and Loggers to the same value at
            the same time.
        </p>
        <p>Values for the above three settings can be edited/changed and updated by
            using the Update button.
