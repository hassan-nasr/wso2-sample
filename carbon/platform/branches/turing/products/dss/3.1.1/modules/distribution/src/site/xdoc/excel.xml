        <h1>Step-by-Step Guide on Creating Data Services Using Excel Data Sheet</h1>
        <br/>
        <p>
            <b>Introduction</b>
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>WSO2 Data Services Server supports to expose data in Excel 97-2007 as a service. We can create Excel data sources in two different modes.</p>
	<ul>
	    <li><a href="#non_qmode">Non-Query mode</a></li>
	    <li><a href="#qmode">Query-mode</a></li>
	</ul>
	
        <p>
            <b>Sample Excel Data sheet</b>
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>Before we start on create the data service we will create an excel sheet which contains
            three columns, namely ID, Model and Classification (i.e. Do not paste the above content
            into a single cell). Fill the data sheet with some values under those three columns.
        </p>

	<h2 id="non_qmode">Excel Data Sources in non-query Mode</h2>
	<p>
	This functionality allows to expose the content of an Excel sheet as a service. 
	</p>
        <p>
            <b>Step 1: Start by giving a name</b>
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>Lets start to create the data service by click on "Create" link under
            Manage/Services/Add/Data Service.
            We will name the service as ExcelSampleService. Click on "Next" button once you enter
            the name, and the description if required.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Step 2: Enter details about your Excel file.</b>
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>Next step is to provide the details about the excel file. Select the Data Source Type as
            "EXCEL" from the drop down list after you giving a name to the data source. Then enter
            the location of the excel file and save.
        </p>

        <p>Figure 3: Configure data source</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Created data source will list as below. Click on "Next" to create the query.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Step 3: Enter excel and query details using which values will be extracted, and
                configure how the response should look like
            </b>
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>Lets name the Query Id as sheet1Query and select the data source which created in
            previous
            step amd fill the excel sheet details. Enter a name for Grouped By Element and Row Name.
            You can also give a namespace if you wish.
            Click on "Add Output Mapping" button to create how the output should look like. Lets
            create
            ID as an element and Name and Classification as attributes. Save the query once you
            enter
            the details.
        </p>

        <br/>
        <p>Once you add a query, it will be listed as follows. Click on "Next" to create the
            operation.
        </p>

            <b>Step 4: Create a web service operation</b>
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>Click on "Add on Operation", and enter a name to the operation. Lets name it as
            getProducts.
            Select the created query from the drop down list and save the operaion.
        </p>

        <p>Figure 7: Add operation</p>
        <br/>
        <hr/>
        <p>Existing operations will be listed as follows. Click on "Finish" button. Service will be
            created and deployed.
        </p>

            <b>Step 5: Service deployed</b>
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>Now we have created a data service. You can go the deployed services list which is under
            Manage/Service/List. Created service will be list as follows.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Step 6: Try your service</b>
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>By click on "Try It" link you can invoke the created service.</p>
        <br/>

        <p>Click on the deployed service and click on "Edit Data Service(XML Edit)" to view the data
            service in xml format.

        <p>Figure 11: Edit data service</p>
        <br/>
	<h2 id="qmode">Excel Data Sources in Query Mode</h2>
	<p>This functionality allows users to query an Excel sheet in a much familiar SQL-like manner, and expose it as a service.
	Internally org.wso2.carbon.dataservices.sql.driver.TDriver class will be used as the SQL Driver. It is a JDBC driver implemenation
	 to be used with tabular data models such as Google SpreadSheets, Excel sheets.
	</p>
	
	<p>
            <b>Step 1: Start by giving a name</b>
        </p>
        <hr/>
	<p>As we did earlier lets start by creating a new data service. Let's name it as 'ExcelQueryModeSampleService'.</p>
        <br/>
        <img alt="DS" src="images/ds-wizard/excel/step1_qmode.png"/>
        <p>Figure 12: Create excel data service</p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            <b>Step 2: Enter details about your Excel file.</b>
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>Now let's provide the details about the excel file. Select the Data Source Type as
            "EXCEL" from the drop down list after you giving a name to the data source. 
	  Then select "Use Query Mode" check box.
	  Then enter the location of the excel file and Save.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <img alt="DS" src="images/ds-wizard/excel/step2_qmode.png"/>
        <p>Figure 13: Configure data source</p>
        <br/>
	<p>As we did earlier click on "Next" to create the query.</p>

	<p>
            <b>Step 3: Define the Query, input parameters and output parameters. 
            </b>
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>Lets name the Query Id as excelQuery and select the data source which created in
            previous step. You can see that UI will allow you to define the query, which was 
	   not supported earlier. Enter the query as given in the below UI and click
	  on 'Generate Input Mappings' to auto generate the input mapping parameters. 
        </p>
        <br/>
        <img alt="DS" src="images/ds-wizard/excel/step3_qmode.png"/>
        <p>Figure 14: Create query</p>
	<br/>
	<p>Once you add a query, click on "Next" to create the
            operation.
        </p>
	<br/>
	<p>
            <b>Step 4: Create a web service operation</b>
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>Click on "Add on Operation", and enter a name to the operation. Lets name it as
            insertProducts.
            Select the created query from the drop down list and click on 
	   'Add Query Params as Operation Params' to add the parmeters to operation.
	    Now save the operation. 
        </p>
        <br/>
        <img alt="DS" src="images/ds-wizard/excel/step4_qmode.png"/>
        <p>Figure 15: Add operation</p>
        <br/>

	<p>Now Try-it the service and check the excel file for the newly added records.</p>

	<h2>Supported query types</h2>
<p>Currently, this feature provides support for basic SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE functionalities.</p>
<p>Note : Nested quries are currently not supported</p>
<br/>
<p>Eg:</p>
<p>SELECT customerNumber,customerName,phone,state,country FROM customers</p>
<p></p>
<p><img alt="Sample SELECT query" src="./images/user-guide/sql-driver/select_query.png"/>
   <br/>
</p>
<p>INSERT INTO customers(customerNumber,customerName,contactLastName) VALUES(?,?,?)</p>
<p></p>
<p><img alt="Sample INSERT query" src="./images/user-guide/sql-driver/insert_query.png"/>
   <br/>
</p>
<p>UPDATE customers SET contactFirstName=?, contactLastName=? WHERE customerNumber=?</p>
<p></p>
<p><img alt="Sample UPDATE query" src="./images/user-guide/sql-driver/update_query.png"/>
   <br/>
</p>
<p>DELETE FROM customers WHERE customerNumber=?</p>
<p></p>
<p><img alt="Sample DELETE query" src="./images/user-guide/sql-driver/delete_query.png"/>
   <br/>
</p>

<p>Also we can create new Sheets and drop an existing sheet from a ExcelSheet.</p>

<br/>
<p>Eg:</p>
<p>CREATE SHEET ProductCategories (ProductCode, Category)</p>
<p></p>
<p><img alt="Sample SELECT query" src="./images/user-guide/sql-driver/create_sheet_query.png"/>
   <br/>
</p>
<p>DROP SHEET ProductCategories</p>
<p></p>
<p><img alt="Sample INSERT query" src="./images/user-guide/sql-driver/drop_sheet.png"/>
   <br/>
