        <h1>XSLT Transformation Sample</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>When using data services, the user may come across the need to transform the result as
            they wish. This is handled in
            <a href="http://wso2.org/projects/data-services-server/java">
                WSO2 Data Services Server
            </a>
            using XSLT Transformation, where user can define the transformation
            in xslt and provide the url of the transformation file in the result element.
        </p>
        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>
            The sample data service "ExcelSampleService" should be deployed as per the instructions
            mentioned in
            <a href="deploying_samples.html">Deploying Samples</a>
            section.
        </p>
        <h2>Running the Sample</h2>
        <p>The sample service can be run using the "tryit" tool, which is bundled with 
<a href="http://wso2.org/projects/data-services-server/java">WSO2 Data Services Server</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Service Definition</h2>
        <p>
            The Excel sample data service contains two operations "getProducts" to list all the
            products that are manufactured in the company, each result record will contain "ID" and
            "Name" fields. And "getProductClassifications" where to list all the products along with
            the classifications, which contains two result records
            which are "Name" and "classification".
        </p>
        <p>Second operation's ("getProductClassifications") actual output has changed as "product-Name" and
            "product-classification" by using the xslt transformation.
        </p>
        <h2>Sample Run</h2>
        <p>
            A sample run of the service using the "tryit" tool is shown below.
