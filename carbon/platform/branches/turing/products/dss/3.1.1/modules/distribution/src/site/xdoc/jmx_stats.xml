        <h1>JMX Statistics</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="http://wso2.org/projects/data-services-server/java">WSO2 Data Services Server</a> provides statistics on the data services it has deployed, using Java Management Extensions (JMX) technology. However using this interface, the server itself, deploying/undeploying services and any operational changes cannot be done.
        </p>
        <h2>Accessing the Registered Data Services MBeans</h2>
        <p>
            A JMX MBean is registered per data service that is deployed. The Object Name of an MBean has the following format,
"org.wso2.carbon.dataservices.jmx:section=Services,service=$SERVICE_NAME", where $SERVICE_NAME is the name of the data service. The MBeans contains information regarding the data service's data sources, queries etc.. A sample session using the "jconsole" tool is shown below in Figure 1.
