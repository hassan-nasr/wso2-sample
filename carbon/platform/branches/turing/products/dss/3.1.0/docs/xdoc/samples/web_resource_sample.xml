        <h1>Web Resource Sample</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p>WSO2 Data Services Server supports to scrape web information and extract web information
 as a service. This sample will use <a href="http://weather.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Weather Forecasts</a>  to extract weather information.</p>

	<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>
            The sample data service "WebResourceSample" should be deployed as per the instructions mentioned in <a href="deploying_samples.html">Deploying Samples</a> section.
        </p>

	<h2>Running the Sample</h2>
        <p>The sample service can be run using the "tryit" tool, which is bundled with <a href="http://wso2.org/projects/data-services-server/java">WSO2 Data Services Server</a>, or a code-generated java client sample using this service.
        </p>
	<h2>Web Resource Information</h2>
        <p>
            The web resource extracts weather information from <a href="http://weather.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Weather Forecasts</a>
        </p>
	<h2>Service Definition</h2>
