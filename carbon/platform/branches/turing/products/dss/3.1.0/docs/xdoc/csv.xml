        <h1>Step-by-step guide on creating data Services using CSV file</h1>
        <p>
            <b>Introduction</b>
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>WSO2 Data Services Server provides the capability of exposing data from a CSV (Comma
            seperated
            Text file) file as a service over the web. This guide will use a csv file which has
            hosted by USGS
            (<a href="http://www.usgs.gov">http://www.usgs.gov</a>). USGS provides reliable
            scientific
            information to describe &amp; understand the Earth. As part of its services, USGS hosts
            latest
            earthquake information in comma separated (CSV) text files online.
        </p>
        <p>This guide explains how to create a web service that will expose earthe quake information
            - the SOA way, using WSO2 Data Services Server.
        </p>

        <p>The guide will be using the CSV file available @
            <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/catalogs/eqs1day-M1.txt">
                http://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/catalogs/eqs1day-M1.txt
            </a>
            and expose its 9 columns
            conforming to following xml format.

            <b>Step 1: Start by giving a name</b>
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>Lets begin to create the data service by clicking on "Create" link in left menu under
            Services/Add/Data Service. It requires to enter a name to the Data service.
            Lets name it as EarthquakeInfoService and click on "Next".

            <b>Step 2: Enter details about your CSV file</b>
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>Second step is to enter details about the data source which we are using to create the
            service. Not only from an online hosted file, you can also use a CSV file which is in
            your local machine.

        <p><h3>Column Separator Values</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Single Character = "X" (X is any character), e.g. ","</li>
            <li>Tab = "\t"</li>
            <li>Space = "\s"</li>
            <li>Any Unicode Character = "\uXXXX" (XXXX is the hexadecimal unicode value)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Click on "Save" once you have entered the details about the data source. Created data
            source will be listed as below. Click on "Next" to add queries.
        </p>

            <b>Step 3: Configure how the response should look like</b>
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>You can enter the details of the query to create the structure of the response you
            wish.
        </p>
        <p>Enter a name to the query, and select the data source name from the drop down, which is
            created in previous step. Enter a name for Grouped By Element and Row Name. You can also
            give a namespace if you wish. Click on "Add Output Mapping" button to create how the
            output should look like.
            Once you have entered the output mapping details click on "Main Configuration" and lick
            on "Save" button.
        </p>
	<br/>
	<p>Please note that when you are defining each output parameter, you can give column number if you gave 'false'
	for 'Contains Column Header Row' when creating the excel datasource. If you gave 'true'for 'Contains Column Header Row'
	you have to specify column names. Since we gave 'false' in previous step we can define each output parameter with column numbers. </p>
