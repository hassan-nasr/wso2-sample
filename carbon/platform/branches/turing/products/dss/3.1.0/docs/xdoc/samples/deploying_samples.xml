        <h1>Deploying Data Services Samples</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The data services samples consists of several data services configuration files (.dbs), which are to be deployed in <a href="http://wso2.org/projects/data-services-server/java">WSO2 Data Services Server</a>. Also if a data service contains a services.xml file, it should also be deployed alongside the .dbs file.
        </p>
        <h2>Deploy</h2>
        <p>
            Follow the below steps for deploying the data services samples.
            <ol>
                <li>Stop the currently running Data Services Server - This is recommended, to clean the current sample database and redeploy the services.
                </li>
                <li>Remove the current sample database and remove existing sample data services. <br />
                    # cd CARBON_HOME/samples <br />
                    # ant clean
                </li>
                <li>Deploy all the samples. <br />
                    # ant
                </li>
                <li>Start the Data Services Server <br />
                    # cd CARBON_HOME/bin <br />
                    # wso2server.bat|sh
                </li>
