        <h1>CSV Sample</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Usage of CSV files is an easy and a common way of storing simple tabular data. In this sample, it demonstrates the usage of a CSV file as a data source
in <a href="http://wso2.org/projects/data-services-server/java">WSO2 Data Services Server</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>
            The sample data service "CSVSampleService" should be deployed as per the instructions mentioned in <a href="deploying_samples.html">Deploying Samples</a> section.
        </p>
        <h2>Running the Sample</h2>
        <p>The sample service can be run using the "tryit" tool, which is bundled with <a href="http://wso2.org/projects/data-services-server/java">WSO2 Data Services Server</a>, or a code-generated java client sample using this service is demonstrated in the <a href="ds_clients.html">Data Services Clients Sample</a> section.
        </p>
        <h2>CSV File Contents</h2>
        <p>
            The CSV file (CARBON_HOME/samples/resources/Products.csv) contains data about the products that are manafactured in an automobile company. So here the products refer to cars/motorocyles. The data table has "ID, Name, Classification, Price" columns.
        </p>
        <h2>Service Definition</h2>
        <p>
            The CSV data source based data service contains a single operation "getProducts" to list all the products that are manufactured in the company.
        </p>
        <h2>Sample Run</h2>
        <p>
            A sample run of the service using the "tryit" tool is shown below. <br />
