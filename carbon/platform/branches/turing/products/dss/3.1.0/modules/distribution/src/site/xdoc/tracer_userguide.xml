        <h1>Tracer</h1>

        <p>This tracer shows the SOAP messages, their respective SOAP message
            requests and responses when the services are deployed on the server, and the
            invoked operations. Make sure that the messages are monitored by turning the
            SOAP Tracer on. By default, it is switched off. You can switch it on by
            selecting ON in the list.</p>

        <p><strong>Warning</strong>:Turning this on will have a performance hit,
            since all SOAP messages will be always completely built (i.e., deferred
            building will not be done) and stored in the database by WSO2 Data Services Server. Hence
            this option should be used with caution.</p>

        <p>The tracer will only show the messages of the operations that were invoked
            after switching on the SOAP tracing.</p>
        <p>By using this SOAP tracer, it is possible to see the SOAP messages with
            their time-stamps, service name, operation invoked and the number of requests
            to the server. The most recent SOAP messages are listed on the top. When a
            particular SOAP message is selected, its Request and the Response can be
            viewed in collapsible/expandable text boxes.</p>
        <p>Note: This tracer does not apply to operations invoked in the admin
            services, as they are filtered out.</p>
