        <h1>Automated Data Service Creation Through DB Connection</h1>

        <p>
            <b>Introduction</b>
        </p>
        <hr/>

        <p><a href="http://wso2.com/products/data-services-server/">WSO2 Data Services Server</a>
            provides the feature to create data services automatically using a given database structure. When generating the service, DS Generator will consider the table structure. According to the given table structure "SELECT", "INSERT", "UPDATE", and "DELETE" operations will get automatically created.
        </p>


        <p>
            <b>Step 1 - Create a Carbon Data Source</b>
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p> Before generating the data services Carbon data source should be created according to the database properties.

            <b>Step 2 - Select Data Source</b>
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>To start the ds generation click on 'Generate' link on your left hand menu.

        <p> In the first screen that appears select the Carbon Data Source and the Database Name as shown below.

            <b>Step 3 - Select Database Schema</b>
        </p>   <hr/>
        <p>After Data Source is selected, DB Schema needs to be selected to identify the needed tables.

        <p>
            <b>Step 4 - Select Tables</b>
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p> Once the schema is selected, the table structure will display according to the given schema. Select the preferred tables for the data service generation.
        </p>

            <b>Step 5 - Select the Service Generation Mode</b>
        </p>   <hr/>
        <p> Once tables are defined, service generation mode needs to be specified. There are two options to generate the data service. 1. as a single service - where all operations for each table are given in a single data service. 2. Multiple services for each table - where for a given table only operations related to that table will be specified. Following example creates a single service for all tables as shown below. 
        </p>

	 <p> Once service generation mode is selcted, data services will get deployed, click next to view deployed services and click finish.

            <b>Step 8: Service deployed</b>
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>Now we have created a data service. You can go the deployed services list which is under
            Manage/Service/List. Created service will be list as follows. If multiple service mode is selected, multiple services will get generated according to the number of tables selected.

            <b>Step 9 - Try your service - Single Service Mode</b>
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>Click on "Try It" link to invoke the service. As seen in Figure 6, operations (Select, Update, Insert and Delete) for both tables are embedded in the same data service. 
        </p>

            <b>Step 9 - Try your service - Multiple Service Mode</b>
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>If Multiple service Mode is selected, different data services will get generated per each table.
        </p>
