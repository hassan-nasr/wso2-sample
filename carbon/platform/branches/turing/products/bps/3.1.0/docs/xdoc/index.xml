        <p>
            WSO2 Business Process Server (BPS) is an easy-to-use Open Source Business Process Server that executes
            business processes written following WS-BPEL standard. WS-BPEL is emerging as the de-facto standard for
            composing multiple synchronous and asynchronous web services into collaborative and transactional process
            flows which increase the flexibility and agility of your Service Oriented Architecture. @product.name@ is powered
            by
            <a href="http://ode.apache.org">Apache ODE</a>
            and available under
