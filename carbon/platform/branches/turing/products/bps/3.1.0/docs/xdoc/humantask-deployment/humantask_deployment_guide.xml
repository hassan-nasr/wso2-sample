        <h2 id="HumanTask-Deployment">Human Task Deployment</h2>

        <p>
            Each Human Task artifact is a zipped file with all relevant deployment artifacts.
            It should contain the task deployment descriptor, one or more human task definitions (.ht files),
            WSDL and JSPs files for rendering task input and output. The task deployment descriptor
            is a file named htconfig.xml (see the next paragraph for its description).
        </p>
        <p>
            During deployment, the task engine loads all documents from the deployment descriptor. Loading documents
            allow it to reference tasks, service and schema definitions using fully qualified names, and import
            based on namespaces instead of locations.
        </p>

        <p>Two ways to deploy a task in @product.name@</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Using the @product.name@ Web Management Console</b>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Login to BPS Management Console by providing your credentials (default:- user:admin pass:admin). Go to <b>Add</b>
                menu item under the <b>Human Tasks</b> section of the left pane of the Management Console.<br/>
            </p>
            <img src="../images/humantask-deployment-guide/humantask_deployment_menu.png" alt="Add Human Task"/>

            <p>
                 Browse and select the zipped Human Task archive. You can upload multiple task artifacts
                in a single upload using the <b>+</b> button and selecting artifacts one after another.
                <br/>
            </p>
            <img src="../images/humantask-deployment-guide/humantask_upload_screen.png" alt="Add Human Task"/>
            <p><br /></p>
            </li>



            <li><b>Manually copying the zipped task artifact file</b>
            <br/>
            <p>
                To deploy manually, just copy the zipped task definition file containing your artifacts, to the
                BPS_HOME/repository/deployment/server/humantasks directory. In this case, you need to be aware of the structure
                of the zipped task configuration. The deployment descriptor (i.e. htconfig.xml file) should be in the root of the zip.
            </p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="Listing-HumanTask-Artifacts">Listing HumanTask Artifacts</h2>

        <p>
            Once you have uploaded a human task artifact, it will be listed under the human task package listing page. Go to
            <b>Manage &gt; HumanTasks &gt; List </b>   from the management console. (Refer the image below:)
        </p>

        <h2 id="HumanTask-Artifact-UnDeployment">UpDeploying a HumanTask Artifact</h2>

        <p>
            You can un-deloy a Human Task artifact using the <b>Undeploy</b> link in the package details page. You can navigate to the package
            details by clicking on the package name on the the package listing page.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>
                NOTE: Once you un deploy a human task package, all the task instances related to that package will be sent to Obsolete state.
            </b>
        </p>
