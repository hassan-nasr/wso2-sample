                    Yes. You can debug a BPEL process using the Event Table in the Instance View of Management Console or using the Message Tracer.

                    The deploy.xml file acts as the deployment descriptor for a BPEL package. It maps configuration information such as partner links, WSDL service, port, etc for processes in a BPEL archive.

		    Add <code>log4j.logger.org.wso2.carbon.bpel.messagetrace=TRACE</code> to log4j.properties file (located at @product.name@-@product.version@/repository/conf/log4j.properties) and set the Carbon log file threshold to trace. i.e. <code>log4j.appender.CARBON_LOGFILE.threshold=TRACE</code> Now re-start the BPS server and send a single request to the BPEL process and find the log file: BPS_HOME/repository/logs/wso2carbon.log

                    Yes. @product.name@ exposes business processes written in BPEL as web services. These services can be executed by a proxy service hosted in WSO2 Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) just like any other web service.

                    WS-BPEL 2.0 does not address human interactions directly. The BPEL4People is an extension to WS-BPEL 2.0 and is used to model human interactions within a BPEL process through the use of an extension activity.

                    How do I deploy a third party library into the BPS?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    You can deploy any third party jar into the repository/components/lib directory. You also need to
                    restart the server for the newly deployed jars to be picked up by the server runtime. @product.name@ will
                    convert any jar files copied into the above location into OSGi bundles. These OSGi bundles are
                    placed in the repository/components/dropins directory.

                   Yes, you can extend the management console easily by writing a custom UI component.

                    Yes you can. You can connect @product.name@ with any external user store implementation.
                    The user store could be LDAP based, JDBC based or a custom developed user store. Please
                    refer <a href="user.core/admin_guide.html">user core documentation</a> for more details.

                    Hot deployment/hot update may take the system to inconsistent states if the updates are not properly
                    coordinated. Therefore it is recommended to turn hot deployment and hot update off for
