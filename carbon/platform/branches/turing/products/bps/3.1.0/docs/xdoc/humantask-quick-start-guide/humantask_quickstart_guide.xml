        <h2 id="Deploying-A-Task-Artifact">Human Task Artifact Deployment</h2>

        <p>
            Once you have developed your task artifact you can deploy it following the steps given in the
            <a href="../humantask-deployment/humantask_deployment_guide.html">Human Task deployment guide</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can use the sample task configuration packed with the WSO2 BPS @product.version@ which could be found in
            <b>BPS_HOME/repository/samples/humantask/ClaimsApprovalTask.zip</b>
        </p>

        <h2 id="Creating-Roles-Users">Creating User Roles and Users</h2>

        <p>
            Before you can create tasks, you need to create users and roles associated with your task definition. The logical people groups
            will be associated with the Carbon roles. Hence you need to create Carbon roles for each logical people group provided in your
            task configuration.  Once the roles are created users who are intended to be associated with those roles should be added.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li><b>Adding Roles</b>
                <p>In the management console go to <b>Configure &gt; Users and Roles</b>. You can add roles by clicking on <b>Roles</b> link. The add new
                    role screen would take you to a simple wizard to create a new role in BPS.
                </p>
                <p><img src="../images/humantask-quick-start-guide/add_role.png" alt="Add User Roles Screen"/></p>

                <p>
                    Once you have provided the matching role names in the task configuration you should associate minimum permissions
                    for the particular role. If the role being added is intended only to work with task items it should be associated only with
                    <b>Login</b> and <b>View Task List</b> permissions only. Refer the image below for more details.
                </p>

                <p><img src="../images/humantask-quick-start-guide/permissions.png" alt="Add User Roles Screen"/></p>


            </li>

            <li><b>Adding Users</b>
                <p>In the management console go to <b>Configure &gt; Users and Roles</b>. You can add users by clicking on <b>Users</b> link. The add new
                    user screen would take you to a simple wizard to create a new user in BPS.
                </p>
                <p><img src="../images/humantask-quick-start-guide/add_user.png" alt="Add User Screen"/></p>

                <p>
                    Once you have provided the user name and the password you should associate the user with the particular role
                    he should be added to. Refer the image below for more details.
                </p>

                <p><img src="../images/humantask-quick-start-guide/role_association.png" alt="Role Association"/></p>

            </li>
        </ol>


        <h2 id="Creating-Tasks">Creating Tasks</h2>

        <p>
            Once the task is deployed and the related roles and users are created, it is ready to relieve task
            creation messages. Task instances could be created in two methods.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Invoking a BPEL process referring to the human task as a people activity construct.
            </li>

            <li>
                Invoking the Human Task web service directly.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="Listing-Tasks">Viewing tasks and task life cycle</h2>

        <p>The list of tasks related to a particular user can be viewed by visiting the task list page</p>

        for more information about task operations and management.</p>
