How to run this sample

Deploy this sample in BPS. 

In the BPS.xml , enable bam publisher extension as follows.

<tns:ExtensionBundles>
     <tns:runtimes>
         <tns:runtime class="org.wso2.carbon.bpel.bam.publisher.BAMPublisherExtensionBundle"/>
     </tns:runtimes>
</tns:ExtensionBundles>

BAM Server profile is configured to publish the received variable data to bam. 
You need to have bam server up, and runing , inorder for the sample to work properly.

This sample publishes the same data that is published by the KPI sample in bam2. Hence the same
toolbox can be used to visualise the data published.

With enableLoadBalancing attribute in Connection element, you can define whether to use the LoadBalancing data
publisher or Async data publisher. 

When the enableLoadBalancing=false, it will use aysnc data publisher and it will only publish data to one bam 
server. When enableLoadBalancing=true, you can publish data to multiple bam servers in a round robin manner. For
that scenario, you can configure mulitple bam publishing urls in a comma seperated manner.
