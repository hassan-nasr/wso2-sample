NOTE: The system property, applyPatches (-DapplyPatches), is no longer used. We have automated the patch application/reverting process. 
Drop the patches to $CARBON_HOME/repository/componenets/patches directory and restart the system WITHOUT this system property. 
When you want to revert a patch, delete it from the patches directory and restart the system WITHOUT this property.

System Requirements
=======================
1. Minimum memory - 1GB
2. Processor      - Pentium 800MHz or equivalent at minimum
3. Java SE Development Kit 1.6.24 or higher
4. The Management Console requires you to enable Javascript of the Web browser,
   with MS IE 7. In addition to JavaScript, ActiveX should also be enabled
   with IE. This can be achieved by setting your security level to
   medium or lower.
5. To build WSO2 BPS from the Source distribution, it is necessary that you have
   JDK 1.6.24 version and Maven 3.0.4 or later

Running Samples
=======================
BPS samples are available at CARBON_HOME/repository/samples directory.

The samples could be deployed with wso2bps-samples.sh script located in  CARBON_HOME/bin directory.
Ex: Running the following command would deploy the HelloWorld2.zip sample file found in the samples
 folder.
wso2bps-samples.sh -s HelloWorld2.zip

The simple axis2 server which resides in BPS_HOME/samples/axis2Server directory,
should be started before running LoanProcess sample.
