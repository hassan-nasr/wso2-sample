<h1>Trusted Identity Providers</h1>
<p>This user guide describes the user identity management related options and configurations available in the WSO2 Identity Server.</p>

<p>You can use the left hand side &quot;Configure&quot; menu to complete the below mentioned configuration and options details.</p>

<h2>Trusted Identity Providers Management</h2>
<p>
    Trusted Identity Providers are the Identity Providers that are trusted by that tenant.
    These Identity Providers can be configured by tenant admins. These Trusted Identity Providers can be used for many different use cases.
    E.g. The SAML2 Assertion Profile for OAuth2 uses the trusted Identity providers to verify the SAML Assertion.
</p>
<p>
    Following  section describes adding Trusted Identity Providers to the system by Administrator. Click on Configure tab &gt; Trusted IdPs.
    The Trusted Identity Providers Management page will be shown which is depicted in the Figure 1.
    From here you can add new Trusted Identity Providers for the tenant by clicking on the Add New Trusted Identity Provider link at the top.
    You can also edit and delete registered Trusted Identity Providers by clicking the corresponding links against them.
